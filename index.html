    <p>The following data visualization follows Education Attainment in the United States over a period of 10 years, and seeks to visually illucidate and uncover trends and patterns in the associated Census Data. Our project looks at Education Attainment in the United States of America during a ten-year period various scale levels and education levels. The scales of interest explored in our data visualization are the national level, regional level, and state level, and in exploring these distinct scales we seek to expose relations at lower levels that might contribute towards trends at larger levels.</p>
    <p>We also seek to explore how Educational Attainment is influenced by gender, and income levels (expressed through the type of schooling system).</p>
